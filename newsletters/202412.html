      <h3>GEARS fundraiser, win a custom modded game boy pocket</h3>
      <p>I'm currently doing a fundraiser through my <a href="https://twitch.tv/ohnotomsutton">twitch channel</a> for <a href="https://edmontonanimalrescue.org/">Greater Edmonton Animal Rescue Society</a>, with the goal of raising $1000 for them by the end of 2024.

      <p>GEARS is a local animal welfare charity that finds homes for animals in need, and they adopted my best friend Sam to me in 2023. I'm just supporting them in their mission so they can continue to find more homes like this for dogs like him.</p>

      <h3>nostialgic and flavorful anime you can watch for free on youtube right now</h3>
      <p>Sometimes, I go trolling for anime on youtube. I like the idea of coming across hidden gems and discovering things which may be 30-40 years old but still have appeal and hold my attention, and charm me in some way or another. Here is a short list of some of the anime which has caught my attention. I'm recommending these for their aesthetic and entertainment value. I totally acknowledge the problematic things in 80s and 90s anime which do not need to be there and we'd now think of as offensive in a lot of contexts. At the same time, there are elements of the craft, narrative, and vibe you can enjoy if you decide not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Like crushing an entire pizza on a friday night, sometimes its alright to enjoy a little trash. <a href="">(complete j sub playlist)</a> <a href="">(complete e dub playlist)</a></p>
      <p>WINDARIA <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWtFUzTsI2k">(j sub)</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfcdcs_g92I">(e dub - vhs rip)</a></p>
      <p>Windaria is a ghibli-esque sweeping adventure about the rivalry between kingdoms. You can tell that for the time it was quite a large production.<p>
      <p>LEGEND OF LEMNEAR <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qutzqKcipQQ">(j sub)</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/F7QsakjFxjw">(e dub)</a></p>
      <p>Lemnear is schlock, but that being said, its my favorite kind of schlock. You could see it as a gender-bent anime version of Conan the Barbarian: its a sword and sorcery where the last-of-their-tribe take on the evil wizard who exterminated their people.</p>
      <p>BAOH - THE VISITOR <a href="">(j sub)</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/rcfykg9jIZM">(e dub)</a></p>
      <p>Again, its trash but its very good trash.</p>
      <p>GOLDEN BOY (j sub) (e dub)</p>
      <p>Golden Boy is notorious for 1) being super horny 2) being hilarious. The main character is a polymathic knowledge sponge who goes from job to job in an attempt to soak up as much learning as possible. Over the course of 6 episodes he enounters different femme fatales who challenge him while he plays the clever underling.</p>
      <p>VIDEO GIRL AI (j sub) (e dub)</p>
      <p>The animation is not great, save for the introduction and the ending.</p>
      <p>OUTLANDERS <a href="https://youtu.be/mf_jN4s_T-E">(j sub)</a> (e dub)</p>
      <p>its some kind of fever dream</p>
      <p>DRAGON'S HEAVEN (j sub) (e dub)</p>
      <p>text</p>
      <p>AREA 88 (j sub) (e dub)</p>
      <p>This one is about a guy who is drawn into being a mercenary pilot for a small, rich, Middle Eastern state. The world and circumstance they set up is pretty interesting, and the vehicle animation is 100% on point. The protagonists main plot of reuiniting with his beloved is enough to keep you invested until the end.</p>
      <p>SHERLOCK HOUND (j sub) (e dub)</p>
      <p>I have a soft spot for Sherlock Hound in the same way that I have one for Star Trek: the Next Generation. Pastel colors, soothing soundscapes, quiet character moments, and an aesthetic filled with such gentility and craft, that if you're not admiring it, it'll lull you to sleep in the best and most comforting way. I often put on the series to either have something on in the background while I'm working or intentionally slip into a nap. The series was directed in part by a young Hayao Miyazaki. The animation quality is simple but consistently good and often impressive, like a favorite restaurant.</p>
