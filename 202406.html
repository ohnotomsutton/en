      <h3>juicing the game</h3>
      <p>I've been working on the final polish for Patchy Matchy, which includes a whole lot of bug hunting and presentational polish. This is a really important part of the process because it makes the difference between a game being visually charming and cute or simple and functional and possibly unimpressive. I get to apply what I know about making appealing motion and visual fun directly to the UI and mechanics of the game. In the industry this is called "juicing" the game, to make the experience savoury. Here are a few of the little visual things I've been working on....</p>

      <h3>meanwhile</h3>
<p>I am not a huge fan of generative AI, for ethical and professional reasons. I could talk about its possible mispercieved role in animation but I feel like I'd be preaching mostly to the choir and it would take too long to assemble the sources to do it justice for this month. Angela Collier, a science youtuber, posted this scathing review of the economic optimism around AI and how it is by and large wholly unfounded, entirely useless if not harmful, and the way corporations are latching onto it (much like they did with NFTs) to attempt to boost their stock profile. She is smart and funny and I highly recommend watching.

      <h3>stuff from tom</h3>
      <p>This month was mostly a whole lot of work on Paw Patrol. I took a little time off last month to visit with family and was playing catch up all month. Starting next month I'll be saying goodbye to episodes and working on a different Paw Patrol production for a while. The team I partly oversaw was about 20 people, but I shared that responsibility with 3 other leads. On this next show I'll be directly overseeing a group of about 12. This probably means less animating and more direct lead tasks like Maya tools, troubleshooting, and training.</p>
      <p> If you're new on Cara looking for some amazing pixel art, I highly recommend following my friend Tofu. She has amazing art skill and channels it into her digital work showing a style and precision for pixel art thats truly exceptional. <a href="https://cara.app/tofu">Follow Tofu on Cara!</a></p>

      <blockquote class="comment"> What I really like about this is the example of how much juice you can squeeze out of static images by knowing some of your aesthetic principles. Squash and stretch always adds a liveliness because it mimics organic forms, and it instantly makes things more visually interesting if they would otherwise be relatively static.
